## Architecture

The application follows the clean architecture with the following components:

### Client

- **Authentication Client:** Responsible for making HTTP calls to retrieve http response.
- **Daemon Client:** Interacts with the daemon process using sockets.

### Repository

- **Authentication Repository:** Retrieves authentication data for the application using the authentication client.
- **Daemon Repository:** Communicates with the daemon via the daemon client and returns the connection status of the daemon.

### Presenter

- **Connection Page:** Binds the connection status provided by the connection service with the UI Widget
